#TEDDIT:  Strings - Student's File
# Teddit is a Ruby text based news aggregator. Think Reddit in your terminal.
# This exercise will be used throughout the ruby portion of this course.
# We will incrementally build a news aggregator (next week using API's)
# We will create a more dynamic Teddit, and pull the latest news stories from Mashable, Digg and Reddit.
# But until then we will hard code stories.
#

#Goals
#1 -  Get the story title, category from user from the command line
#2 -  Write a conditional that determines upvotes' based on the category
#3 -  Save every story to a collection (each story should be a hash)
#4 -  Print each stories title, category and upvotes to the screen
